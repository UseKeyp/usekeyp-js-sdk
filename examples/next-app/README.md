# Kaching

## Descripton

Kaching is a web application that allows users to send and receive cryptocurrencies on the Polygon network. It integrates with Keyp's API (https://docs.usekeyp.com/api), a non-custodial wallet service that uses OAuth2 to grant third-party applications access to user resources without exposing their login credentials. Kaching creates a non-custodial wallet on the Polygon network using Keyp's service, ensuring that the user's private keys are never exposed to Keyp.
How to Use Kaching

## How to Use Kaching

To use Kaching, simply sign in using your Google or Discord account. You will be redirected to Keyp's authorization page to grant Kaching permission to send and receive crypto on your behalf. If you do not have a wallet, Kaching will create one for you.

Kaching's key features are:

- Send - allows you to send cryptocurrency to other users who have also created accounts with Keyp.

- Wallet - displays your wallet balances and transaction history.

- Fund - allows you to fund your wallet with popular onramps.

- Cash out - lets you offramp your funds to popular offramps.
